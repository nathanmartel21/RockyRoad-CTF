# RockyRoad CTF

## Author: Nathan Martel

Welcome to the **RockyRoad** box!

This is a medium-level CTF challenge that will test your skills in various areas of cybersecurity. The main objective is to escalate your privileges to `root` and reveal the hidden `root flag`.

To achieve this, you'll need to go through a series of tasks, including but not limited to:
- Reconnaissance
- Exploits
- Privilege escalation
- Brute force
- And more...

Prepare to think creatively and solve puzzles as you explore the box. Youâ€™ll face different challenges along the way that will require you to use a variety of techniques to achieve your goal.

### Repository Structure

- **Main Branch:** Contains the box itself with all the challenges you need to complete.
- **Correction Branch:** A separate branch where you'll find the solutions to the challenges. This branch is useful if you want to see how everything comes together after completing the challenges.

Good luck, and have fun hacking your way to the flag!
